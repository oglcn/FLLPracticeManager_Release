# FLLPracticeManager
This is an application made to assist in FIRST© Lego Leauge tournaments, in the practice table area. The application will help manage the reservations to the practice tables that teams are requesting during the tournament day(s). This application aims to replace the traditional paper-based reservation system which is currently used in most if not all FLL Tournaments. The application aims to bridge the communication gap and help the event volunteers by centralizing the reservation records. Some other features of the app are to avoid double-booking, auto-fetch availability of all tables and time-slots across event when adding new reservation (with configurable cooldown between teams' reservations, search for reservations based on team or table, display currently working teams with remaining time on the table, and so much more. 

I have developed this app to help solve the issues I have experienced as a Volunteer and Area Coordinator in FIRST© Lego Leauge Explore Tournaments, hosted by Bilim Kahramanları Derneği in Türkiye. Thus, the language of the UI is Turkish. If you would like use this app in any tournament or competiton outside of Turkey, please feel free to fork the repo and contact me for assistance. I will be more than happy to help

This app is developed with .Net 6.0 LTS for the backend and JQuery/Bootstrap for the frontend. I have used MSSQL for database, however any db can be used with minimal modification.
