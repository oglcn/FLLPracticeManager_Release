# Practice Table Reservation App for FIRST© Lego League Tournaments

## Overview
This application is designed to streamline the management of practice table reservations at FIRST© Lego League (FLL) tournaments. It replaces the traditional paper-based system with a digital solution to enhance coordination and communication. This app centralizes reservation records, facilitating the work of event volunteers and improving the overall tournament experience.

## Motivation
I developed this app to address the challenges I encountered as a Volunteer and Area Coordinator at FLL Explore Tournaments. Traditional methods often led to scheduling conflicts and miscommunication. By digitizing the process, this app ensures a smoother operation, enabling volunteers to manage resources more effectively and enhance the experience for all participants.

## Features
- **Easy reservation management:** Streamlines the process of adding, removing, and managing table reservations with a few clicks, enhancing flexibility and control for event coordinators.
- **Prevents double-booking:** Automatically checks for conflicts to ensure tables are not double-booked.
- **Auto-fetches availability:** Dynamically retrieves the availability of all tables and time slots during the event setup.
- **Configurable cooldown for eams** Configurable cooldown period between reservations made by the same team to ensure fair access of all teams to the practice area in high demand.
- **Advanced search options:** Allows searching for reservations based on team or table.
- **Real-time updates:** Displays currently active teams and the remaining time on their reserved table.
- **User-friendly interface:** Developed for ease of use during the high-paced environment of FLL tournaments.

## Technical Details
- **Backend:** Developed with .Net 6.0 LTS, ensuring long-term support and stability.
- **Frontend:** Utilizes JQuery and Bootstrap for a responsive and intuitive user interface.
- **Database:** Primarily uses MSSQL, though the system is designed to work with any database with minimal modifications.

## Localization
The application is currently tailored for Turkish users, as it was originally developed for FLL Explore Tournaments hosted by Bilim Kahramanları Derneği in Türkiye. If you are interested in using this app outside of Turkey, please feel free to fork the repository. I am available to provide support and assistance in adapting the app for your local needs.

## Contribution

## Contact
